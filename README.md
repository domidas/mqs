# Meteorological Query System
This project is a successor to weather-seeker, which was shackled by using a paid API with limited access to information.

The goal of the MQS is to make meteorological information entirely free to access, and therefore it only uses entirely free APIs with no paid options. Where it can find no free API options, it uses web scraping.

These include:
- The National Weather Service API and radar service
- The US Census Bureau Geocoding API

# Run:
from root directory:  
`python3 nws`

# Note:
tool is currently broken because of problems with cache functions
